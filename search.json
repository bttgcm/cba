    "text": "2.1 Background\nWhen looking at the role that the Hindu-Kush-Himalaya (HKH) has in terms of water supply the focus is often given to the population living downhill covering 47% of world population (Pomeranz et al., n.d. ) with most attention given to glaciers and snowpacks. Differently from this approach, this research will focus on the 13 million people living on the hills and mountains of the HKH and on the water source that over 80% of these local communities use, namely, springs Poudel and Duex (2017). Water springs are not only used for drinking water but for a variety of additional uses such as livestock feeding, cleaning, irrigation. Aside from practical use they also carry symbolic and cultural values.\nThese particular conditions related to spring water, have some important implication in the way they are studied: the focus will need to shift from the watershed to the spring-shed, from glaciers to precipitation and recharge possibilities within the spring-shed. The characteristics of this situation (relatively small population affected, a different conceptual framework, lack of data) have probably caused the existing gap in research (tambe_reviving_2012?)."

    "text": "2.2 Problem statement\nHistorically, springs have been managed at community level with different model of governance, the current challenges caused by climate change, different land use, variation of consumption pattern, are placing in a state of crisis the existing governance systems. Remediation and revival activity come at a cost and this is condition is confronted with the general perception of water as a free good by local communities in Nepal (merz_potential_2003?).\nThe identification of revival / remedial practices is therefore challenged by a lack of resources, the complexity of the problem and the necessary mobilization of stakeholders. Within this problematic, cost benefit analysis (CBA) can support decision makers in identifying the most cost-effective solutions, estimating benefit for the community and potentially support a case for intervention. This study aims at carrying a CBA for two springs that have been addressed by revival practices in Namobuddha Municipality, Nepal."

    "section": "3.1 Water Security in Nepal",
    "text": "3.1 Water Security in Nepal\nThe hydrological system of the Himalaya has been experiencing significant stress. This is caused by different factors: climate change is producing a decline in annual precipitation as well as more weather extreme events (see Section 3.3.1 ) ; population increase and lifestyle changes are augmenting water demand; urbanization and development are requiring the construction of infrastructure system that can disrupt the current ecosystem. Additionally, governance institutions are often lacking the management and capacity to properly addressed the issues to face this changing and complex situation.\nThe case of Nepal, well represent these challenges. The country utilizes only a fraction of the available water (15 out of 225 billion \\(m^3\\)) (Joseph and Shrestha 2022). This is due to the rugged geography, political instability, skewed seasonality, capacity and governance gaps. The inability to provide water significantly affects several sectors such as agriculture, industry, health and creates an additional difficulty to the country’s development. A recent report by the World Bank (Joseph and Shrestha 2022) identified five key challenges:\n\nService delivery in Water Supply and Sanitation\nWater Governance for Service Delivery and Integrated Management in a Federal Framework\nIrrigation for Greater Agricultural Productivity and Food Security\nBuilding Resilience—Dealing with Climate Variability and Change\nTrans-boundary Management\n\nUntil recently, mountain water security was studied mostly focusing on glaciers and snowpacks with a strong focus on climate and hydrogeological aspects. Non glacial contribution has been ignored (Ohja &gt; (Andermann et al., 2012; Bookhagen, 2012).).[Research gap on water spring (Tambe et al. 2009; NITI Aayog 2018),] in (sharma_conserving_2019?)\nMore recently the approach is shifting to include groundwater, meltdown pathways, springs, infrastructural interference (Drenkhan et al. 2022) as well as socio-economic aspects. Within this approach, the study of spring water becomes very relevant.\nAn additional reason has been proposed, since studying springs is very intensive due to their number, to move from the spring-centric to the ‘mountain acquifer’ (Tambe et al. 2020)."

    "section": "3.2 State of water springs in Nepal",
    "text": "3.2 State of water springs in Nepal\nIt has been estimated that half of the more than three million perennial springs in the Himalaya have either dried up of have become seasonal. Documentation of this phenomenon starts from the ’80s (Valdiya and Bartarya 1991). Nepal mid-hill region is not excluded from this trend. Chapagain, Ghimire, and Shrestha (2019) found decline in discharge in over 30% of the monitored springs.\nCauses are to be found in the raising of temperature (Pandey et al. 2017), change of precipitation patterns Agarwal et al. (2012), land use and soil erosion Rautela (2015) , changes in forest type Naudiyal and Schmerbeck (2017), infrastructure Mukherji et al. (2018) are contributing to this decline in both water quantity and water quality. Chauhan et al. (2023) quantified the impact of different causes as follows: 62% of identified studies found climate change as a factor of degradation by reducing rainfalls; other factors were infrastructure development (50% of studies), increased water consumption (50%), natural disaster (37%), lack of systemic effort in water conservation (37%), change in land use (37%), limited knowledge of spring hydrology (25%), influx of migrants (25%). It is worth noting that the majority of the identified factors can be managed at the local level. Additionally, more sporadic events such an earthquake, can cause changes in the geohydrological conditions of the affected areas, resulting in drying up some of the springs (Lamichhane et al. 2020)\n\n3.2.1 Spring water research\nGiven the impact of spring water and the current challenges, spring water research ahs been gaining more attention. In Nepal it was initiated by ICIMOD in 2003 (Merz et al. 2003) and since then, several studies have been carried out. The studies are mostly focused on mapping springs and understanding the spring status in terms of discharge trend [(dhakal_mapping_nodate?), Chapagain, Ghimire, and Shrestha (2019), Gurung et al. (2019), Pandit, Shakya, and Shrestha (2019), Adhikari et al. (2021)], exploring the causes of spring degradation (Dhakal et al., 2015; Sharma et al., 2016; Poudel & Duex, 2017), water quality assessment (Gurung et al., 2019b; Pandit et al., 2019; Khadka & Rijal, 2020; Thapa et al., 2020; Tiwari et al., 2020) and springs distribution modeling (Ghimire et al., 2019; Pradhan & Shrestha, 2022), Spatially, most of the districts of the mid-hills and lesser Himalaya have been covered for analysis (Table 3). Methodologically, the majority of the studies are perception-based and have adopted household surveys, questionnaire surveys, focused group discussions (FGDs), and key informant interview methods (Merz et al., 2003a, 2003b; Poudel & Duex, 2017; Adhikari et al., 2021).\nTODO read Poudel and Duex (2017),\n\n\n3.2.2 Classification\nSpring classification (daniel2021?)\nSee also (chinnasamy2016?)\nConceptual model for aquifer (tambe2020?)\n\n\n3.2.3 Methods of analysis\nFor a review on methods of analysis see (chinnasamy2016?)\nA list of stressors for water spring was compiled by Daniel (daniel2021?)

    "text": "3.4 Governance\nThe following diagram shows the basic structure of Nepal governance that shows the 4 levels of governance. At the smallest one, the ward, may include one or several springshed. It should be noted that the recent changes with the new constitution towards a federal union, several changes are still in progress concerning new responsibilities and new legal arrangements. According to the World bank, Nepal faces three main institutional challenges: “(1) low capacity for service delivery of local governments; (2) trade-offs in water allocation across subsectors; and (3) implementation of an integrated water resource management in a federal framework” (Joseph and Shrestha 2022 , p.17).\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[1 National] --&gt; B[7 Provinces]\n  B --&gt; C[753 Local gov.]\n  C --&gt; D[6743 Wards]\n  D --&gt; E[000s Springshed]\n\n\n\n\n\nWater Governance - Since 1966 Ministry of Water Resources was originally responsible for all the drinking water supply under its Department of Irrigation and Water Supply (Nepal IRC, 1988). From 1971, the department separated into two parts: Department of Irrigation and Department of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS). In latest years water supply under 1500 people are managed by the Ministry of Panchayat and Local Development (MPLD) (Dahal, Thapa, and Shiwakoti 2019). The Water Resources Act of 1992 allows for the formation of water user groups to oversee water projects and direct priorities. The Water Resource Strategy of 2022 defines the water sector priorities as well as the actions, indicators and timeline. It proposes the use of basin planning units and Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) Chauhan et al. (2023) . With the Local Government Operation Act 2074, Rural Municipalities are responsible on the management of water and sanitation (White 2018). The legal basis to the right of water are stated in the new constitution of 2015.\nThis process of decentralization has created some issues: power needs to be redistributed across institutions, in the case of IWRM World Bnk noted that “The federal and provincial governments have major responsibilities when it comes to integrated water management; however, the role the local governments will play to facilitate its operationalization, or basin-scale planning, is unclear.” (joseph2022?). This causes possibility of conflict between federal and local government. A governance issues very linked to hydrology is the mismatch between hydrological units and governance units. A river basins can cover several municipalities (palikas), the same issue would be experienced if using watershed as basic units but peraphs at a smaller scale.\nAnother issue is the lack of technical capacity to plan and execute projects. Since decentralisation, local governments were not able to spend part of the budget due to capacity constraints (Bank n.d.). In addition, significant budget loss were experienced due to low efficiency and accountability issues.\nSocial inclusion within (water) governance - even if efforts are being made to increase social inclusion in the decision making process (see Rural Village Water Resources Management Project as an example), therefore gaps still exist in the participation of disadvantaged groups and woman.\n[set of suggestion at policy level in (Chauhan et al. 2023)]\n[use of water]\n\n\n\n\nAdhikari, Sanot, Anup Gurung, Raju Chauhan, Deepak Rijal, Bhawani S.

    "section": "4.1 Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA)",
    "text": "4.1 Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA)\nCost benefit Analysis (CBA) is “a policy assessment method that quantifies in monetary terms the value of all consequences of a policy to all members of society” (Boardman et al. 2018). It has been used for decades to support decision making. The first adoption was done in the ’30s in the united States for the construction of a dam. the essence of the tool is quite simple: it aims at measuring, in monetary terms, the benefits of an action / event versus the costs of implementing it. Often it target two specific set of problems such as the implementation of a new policy or the feasibility of a specific project (Hanley and Barbier 2009). Several guidelines exist Hanley and Barbier (2009) and have been reviewed by Abelson (2020) underlying strengths, weaknesses and gaps.\nWhile CBA has been widely used for decades, its application on environmental remediation is more recent but has been growing also due to the increasing interest in concept as ecosystem services. Mendelsohn and Olmstead (2009) and Atkinson and Mourato (2008) gives a review of economic valuation for the environment while Brauman et al. (2007) focuses on hydrological aspects and Ratnaweera, Heistad, and Navrud (2021) on water services [expand with key differences from other CBA].\nFor Nepal, CBA have been carried on the willingness to pay for conservation activities in Nepal (Lamsal et al. 2015), valuing environmental costs of local development (Pakhtigian and Jeuland 2019) as well as transaction costs (Adhikari and Lovett 2006), valuing ecosystem services Kc, Kandel, and Adhikari (2013), households preferences for time and money contribution for river restoration (Khatiwada, Bohara, and Kunwar 2023). CBA for soil and water conservation was carried in Sikkim (Mishra and Rai 2014).\nIn the following sections, using the steps proposed by Boardman et al. (2018), the scope, decisions and assumption for this research are shown.\n\n4.1.1 Purpose of the CBA\nThe CBA aims at valuing the cost-benefit of spring revival techniques in two different locations: Bhagwate pakhako kuwa in Bhagwate village (Namobuddha-2 municipality) and patalko dhara spring in Thumka village (Namobuddha-2 municipality). The study aims at quantifying the benefit of water flow increase versus the cost of implementation. The two sites present different situations and can be used to evaluate different scenarios. In Patalko Dhara the spring was drying up and the revival interventions started in 2016 and increased the existing water flow.\n\n\n4.1.2 Set of alternative projects\nA first alternative is given from the “business as usual” with no revival actions adopted for the spring water. Additionally, different scenarios were considered based on remedial technicques, diverse land-use and future events (climate change, economic change).

Nonmarket valuation are generally divided into revealed and stated preference methods Boardman et al. (2018).\nFor single type of activities such as contribution to environmental conservation, surveys estimating WTP were used Pakhtigian and Jeuland (2019) asking households about their willingness to contribute with monthly money donation or free labour (Khatiwada, Bohara, and Kunwar 2023). In case of more complex valuations such as ecosystem services, a set of multiple methods were used: market price, travel cost, revealed price, income data, Gov expenditure, benefit transfer and contingent valuation (B. Thapa et al. 2020).\nFor ecosystem valuation, note the difference between intermediate and final services (Mendelsohn and Olmstead 2009, 337). Ecological production function can be used. In the particular case of water resources the method will depend on the use and can range from a market approach that refers to the price to be paid for sourcing water in another way, to the impact of water on agricultural productivity, or using hedonic methods to evaluate the impact of water proximity for agricultural land.\nThe total benefit \n\n4.1.5.1 Discount benefits and costs to obtain present values\nThe present value (PV) is generally estimated as:\n\\[PV (X_t) = X_t [(1+i)^{-t})] \\]\nwhere t stands for time and i is the discount rate.\n[Brief introduction with Stern Review (2007), Nordhaus, Gollier (2008) arguing for declining discount rate (hanley2009?) O’Mahony (2021)\nRecently, alternatives to the discount rate model have been proposed such as the generational model SUMAILA WALTERS Sumaila, U. and C. Walters (2005), ‘Intergenerational discounting: a new intuitive approach’, Ecological Economics, 52, 135–42. [see discount rate used in CBA in Nepal]\nIn the case of Nepal, Mishra and Rai (2014) adopted a 6% interest based on discount rate matching bank loan with a 10 years time horizon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy\nDiscount rate\nTime horizon (yrs)\nReference\nNote\n\n\n\n\nSoil - Water Conservation in Sikkim\n6%\n10\n(mishra2014?)\nDiscount rate matching bank loan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.5.2 Compute the net present value of each alternative\nNet Present Value Test (NPV) is usually adopted to determine whether the discounted benefits $B_t$ will overcome the discounted costs $C_t$. In this case the project can be said to represent an efficient shift in resource allocation.\n\\[\nNPV = \\sum B_t(1+i)^{-t} - \\sum C_t(1+i)^{-t}\n\\]\nOther less used methods include Internal rate of Return (IRR) and Benefit-Cost Ratio.\n\n\n\n4.1.6 Perform sensitivity analysis\n\n4.1.6.1 Recommendation\n\n\n\n4.1.7 Additional critical aspects\nAs in most numerical models that are dependent on several parameters, CBA has also different critical aspects that is worth discussing and clarifying. Starting from a review of seven CBA guidelines (Abelson 2020) the following sections briefly explains assumptions and decision made for each of these aspects.\n\n4.1.7.1 The marginal excess tax burden\n\n\n4.1.7.2 The social discount rate benefit cost Ratio\n\n\n4.1.7.3 Transaction costs\nTransaction costs are often neglected in economic valuation. A study conducted in Nepal on forest management, estimated these cost in the range of 1265-2312 NPR / year per house hold (year 2006), depending on the income level \\parencite{adhikari_transaction_2006}.\nStudies have also looked at soil-water conservation measures. Mishra and Rai Mishra and Rai (2014) found that indigenous practices in Sikkim have a positive NPV (over 10 years at 6% discount rate).\n\n\n4.1.7.4 Risk and uncertainty\nsee OECD\n\n\n4.1.7.5 Time horizon\nO’Mahony (2021)\n\n\n4.1.7.6 The concept of value\nDietz, Fitzgerald, and Shwom (2005)\n\n\n4.1.7.7 Interpretation of costs\nDecision makers will “see” costs differently depending on the relationship they have with them whether they are analyst, spenders or guardians} , three lenses proposes by Sanford Borins and David A. Good (Boardman et al. 2018, p16). Guardians are generally in central budgetary agencies and have roles in control and accounting. Their focus probably lies in the cash flow of their specific agencies and therefore social benefits may not be regarded as high. Spenders generally focus on the delivery of government mandated projects. Expenditures to the public can be seen as a benefit. Analyst would focus more on the overall balance of costs and benefit not necessarily making distinction at different jurisdictional level.\n\n\n4.1.7.8 CBA in developing countries\nAn observation that can be made on “developing countries” economies is that the dependency of a vast part of the population to environmental resources is higher than in “developed world”. Many people are still involved in subsistence farming and often use directly natural resources such as water, wood for basic needs. The strong link to the environment is not only seen in economic activities but also in health. The impact that unsafe water sources, or water induced disaster can have is significant.\nSee Amacher, G., W. Hyde and B. Joshee (1993), ‘Joint production and consumption in traditional households: fuelwood and crop residues in two districts in Nepal’, Journal of Development Studies, 30(1), 206–25.\nBluffstone, Randall A.
